Is intonation important to work on when you are singing by yourself?
Why or why not?
Have your views on your own intonation changed at all?
Now that you have spent some time working on your own intonation, do you have any new ideas on how a choir could work on intonation?

Intonation is important to work on when you're singing by yourself, because if you cannot listen to yourself sing, then you cannot improve. Furthermore, my views on intonation have not changed at all. After some time working on my own intonation, my idea on how a choir can work on intonation would have to be to blend in the dynamics.
