Is intonation important when singing by yourself?  Why or why not?

Intonation is listening and singing in tune along with the chorus. It is important when singing in a group because so you have choral blend. Some factors that can affect the intonation of a group are pitch, dynamics, and memorization. Intonation problems can be fixed through practicing and working on the problems as a group. I believe that intonation is important for singing by yourself as well because you have to hear yourself, and then you can improve through hearing your pitch, dynamics, etc.
