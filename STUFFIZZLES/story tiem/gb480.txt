Once upon a time, there lived a little defaulty boi named GoodBoiNo480. This little default really wanted a skin, but didn't have any v-bucks. GoodBoiNo480 didn't want to spend his money on v-bucks, but instead, he bought an account. This method of getting skins may be considered as illegal to the fortnite terms of service. The account was $25 dollars, and when he bought the account on ebay, Thanos snapped and automatically killed him.
