*voice cracks*
are you bois ready for dis..?
ok
ok
ok
OOF
// music starts playing
Are you alright?
I'm alright, I'm quite NOICE
and my diamond's right
Puttin' them diamonds in my chests
All the way to the limit 'til they be fillin' up
(oof, oof oof)
Countin' my diamonds
On my way to the limit 'til we fallin' over

I don't really care if you die
On the real, you shoulda never dug down
Shoulda saw the way them players look me in my eyes
They said: "You a noob, get a LIFE."
Push me to the void
All my homes are raided
Push me to the void
All my homes are raided
Push me to the void
All my homes are raided

Minecarts that's all iron, inside all gray
Like somethin' you ride a horse down, I just want that gold
My teammate got mad, im barely their friends now
Everybody got the diamonds now
Watch the way I kill them
Stackin' my diamonds all the way to the top
All the way 'til the diamonds fall over
Everytime that you leave your spot
Your teammate call me like, "Let's do a raid!"
I like the way that they treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Lasanga
They say i'm insane, oof
I might blow my pick out
Minecraft, help the pain, yeah
Please, Minecraft, make it go away
Im committed, not addicted but it keep conrtol of me
All the pain, now I can't feel it
I swear it's a slowness potion, oof

I don't really care if you die
On the real, you shoulda never dug down
Shoulda saw the way them players look me in my eyes
They said: "You a noob, get a LIFE."
Push me to the void
All my homes are raided
Push me to the void
All my homes are raided
Push me to the void
All my homes are raided 

That is not your gold, I swear you fake hard
Now these players wanna take my skills
Strike on 'em, killed, Strike on 'em (oof, yuh)
Healing Potion, Lil Noob, take some (oof, oof, oof)
Fast cart, Massacre, race on 'em
In the spawn, ain't got no ones, thenwe would them
Clothes from the minings, got he racks and they all diamonds
You is not an OG though
Lookin' at you stackin' all your diamonds, it all blue though
I was countin' that and  these all sixty-fours, thats an OG-roll

They said: "You're a noob, you're a noob."
I cannot die because this my world

I don't really care if you die
On the real, you shoulda never dug down
Shoulda saw the way them players look me in my eyes
They said: "You a noob, get a LIFE."
Push me to the void
All my homes are raided
Push me to the void
All my homes are raided
Push me to the void
All my homes are raided
