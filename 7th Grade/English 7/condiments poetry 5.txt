Mayonnaise is white
But ketchup is dark red though
Mustard is yellow


Mayonnaise is white
Mayonnaise is made from eggs
Mayonnaise is moist

Ketchup is no gas
Nor is it a solid state
Not liquid either

Mustard can be sweet
It can also be spicy
It's an ancient spice

Pickle made Relish
Enhance food with it's sweetness
From chopped vegetables.
