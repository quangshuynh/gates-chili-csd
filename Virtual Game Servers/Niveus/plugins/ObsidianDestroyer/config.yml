  # Allows the durability of materials to gradually regenerate over time.

  # The explosion radius that will be checked. Blocks in this radius will be affected.
  # Must be greater than zero and not above ten. Will create lag with high radius

  # False means that water and lava won't protect industructable materials from explosions.
