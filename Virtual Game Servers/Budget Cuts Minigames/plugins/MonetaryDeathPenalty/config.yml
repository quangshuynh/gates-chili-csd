# Default config for MonetaryDeathPenalty.
# 
# checkForUpdates - As I update MonetaryDeathPenalty often I've noticed that there are quite a a lot running out-of-date versions of MonetaryDeathPenalty. This will help server owners keep MonetaryDeathPenalty up to date. If there is an update available it will notify any Ops or any players with the mdp.admin permission. I recommend you set this to true just to notify any ops or players/groups with mdp.admin that there is a new version of MonetaryDeathPenalty available.
